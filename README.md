# PreventStealer
A tampermonkey addon for WWW kogama that aims to prevent any sort of JS-based stealers.   
Works by blocking any fetch & xhr outside of native to website API.   
Huge credits to [Zpayer](https://github.com/RandomUser15456) for providing the list of native-to-kogama APIs.


Made with javascript and meant to use with an executor like [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

As of 4th August 2025, the script:  
- Maps all of the native to the website API,
- Blocks any requests that do not match our allowed list,
- Prevents any requests that target password-related endpoints.
