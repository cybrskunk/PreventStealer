# PreventStealer
A tampermonkey addon for WWW kogama that aims to prevent any sort of JS-based stealers.   
Works by blocking any fetch & xhr outside of native to website API.   
Huge credits to [Zpayer](https://github.com/RandomUser15456) for providing the list of native-to-kogama APIs.

### NOTE: THIS SCRIPT IS NOT PERFECT.
There **EXIST** a ton of ways this could be bypassed. Do NOT take your safety for granted.   
**NEVER** test any suspicious scripts on your main account or within an environment where your sensitive data might be exposed.  
**TAKE ALL THE PRECAUTIONS POSSIBLE.**

### What does it even do?
As of 4th August 2025, the script:  
- Maps all of the native to the website API,
- Blocks any requests that do not match our allowed list,
- Prevents any requests that target password-related endpoints.

September 7th Update:    
Now also displays {partially} payload.
